# NetflixClone

### This app was made to teach android studio. Please do not use for your Google play app.

**I will add new features each week that you saw on Netflix so it will be a little long series.**

### Here tool that I will use to create Netflix clone;

**Adobe illustrator;** As a designer, I'm using illustrator to make my designs (for icons etc.) 

**Firebase;** I am going to use firebase as Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS).

so what is **Firebase**? 
**Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) app development platform that provides hosted backend services such as a realtime database, cloud storage, authentication, crash reporting, machine learning, remote configuration, and hosting for your static files.**
